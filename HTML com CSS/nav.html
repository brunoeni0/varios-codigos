	<p><h1><font color="blue">What is Lorem Ipsum?</font></h1>
<b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <strong>industry</strong>.<br> Lorem Ipsum has been the <em>industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s</em>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br> It has <i>survived</i> not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

	<p><h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
<font size="12px" face="Verdana">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.<br> The <sub>point</sub> of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.<br> Many <sup>desktop</sup> publishing <u>packages</u> and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.<br> Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</font></p>
